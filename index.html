    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading (United Kingdom). 
      Her research focuses on Mediterranean cyclones, diabatic processes and Numerical Weather Prediction models. 
      She got her PhD in Atmospheric Science from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, with a thesis focused on cyclogenesis over the South Atlantic Ocean using Global Climate Models and Regional Climate Models. 
      As part of her PhD program, she participated in a sandwich program at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), where she studied the selection of CMIP6 GCM for South America and tropical cyclogenesis within the CORDEX domains. 
      Additionally, during her PhD, she was part of the Western South Atlantic Climate Experiment (WeSACEx) project, and the Group for Climate Studies (GREC) from Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Science (IAG), Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
      She have a master's degree in Atmospheric Science from University of Sao Paulo, in which study the relation between surface wind speed and precipitation with subtropical cyclogenesis in the Southeast coast of Brazil. 
      She has a bachelor's degree  in Meteorology from the São Paulo State University Júlio de Mesquita Filho (UNESP).
